# ðŸš€ SpaceX First Stage Reuse Prediction

Welcome to the **SpaceX Reuse Prediction Project**. This project is focused on analyzing SpaceX launch data to **predict whether the first stage of a rocket will be reused** in future missions. Reusability is a key goal in reducing space travel costs, and understanding the patterns behind successful recoveries is essential.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

SpaceX has been launching rockets since 2006, and a major part of their innovation is the reuse of the first stage of their Falcon rockets. In this project, I use **machine learning models** to analyze historical data and predict the **likelihood of a first stage being reused** in future launches.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze past launch data from SpaceX.
- Identify the key features that influence first-stage recovery.
- Train a classification model to **predict reuse outcome**.
- Evaluate model performance using standard ML metrics.
